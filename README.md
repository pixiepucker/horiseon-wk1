# Horiseon Marketing and Management

## Week 1 Challenge

Horiseon Marketing and Management is the first challenge of many during a 6-month coding bootcamp. This weeks challenge was to refactor and compile both the index.html and style.css files for the Horiseon company.

- Refactoring was done in order to have Horiseon's codebase follow accessibility standards. The following marks what was done:
    - Semantic tags were added to the HTML body and the CSS was edited to reflect these changes.
    - "alts" were added to the images to help those who utilize screenreaders.
    - Comments were put into both HTML and CSS files to clean up the code, making it easier to read for future updates.

By completing this assignment I was able to learn that there are many different ways of fixing erros and to trust the process overall.
